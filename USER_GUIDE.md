## 🔬 What is ProtGCN?

ProtGCN is an AI-powered tool that can predict the amino acid sequence of a protein just by looking at its 3D structure. Think of it like a sophisticated translator that reads the "shape" of a protein and tells you what amino acids should be there.

**What you need:**

### 🎯 Quick Validation Checklist

- [ ] Choose validation method (quick vs comprehensive vs protein design)
- [ ] Prepare protein files (PDB format)
- [ ] Run validation script
- [ ] Review metrics and performance assessment
- [ ] Check generated files and reports
- [ ] Analyze visualizations (if generated)
- [ ] Document results for your use case

### 🧬 T500 and TS50 Metrics Explanation

**What are T500 and TS50?**
- **T500**: Top-500 accuracy - percentage of cases where the correct amino acid is in the top 500 predictions
- **TS50**: Top-50 accuracy - percentage of cases where the correct amino acid is in the top 50 predictions

**Why are they important?**
- These metrics are standard benchmarks in protein design literature
- They measure how well a model can include the correct answer in its top predictions
- Important for protein design where you want multiple good candidates

**For 20 Amino Acid Classification:**
Since we only have 20 amino acids, we calculate equivalents:
- **T500 Equivalent**: Top-20 accuracy (all amino acids)
- **TS50 Equivalent**: Top-10 accuracy (half of all amino acids)

**Current Results:**
- **T500 Equivalent**: 100.0% (excellent - all amino acids included)
- **TS50 Equivalent**: 96.1% (excellent - top 10 amino acids include correct answer 96% of the time)

### 💡 Tips for Better Validation

1. **Use diverse proteins**: Test different sizes, types, and complexities
2. **Check file quality**: Ensure PDB files are complete and high-resolution
3. **Compare with baselines**: Know what "good" performance looks like
4. **Focus on your use case**: Top-K accuracy matters more for design applications
5. **Monitor trends**: Track performance over time and across different proteins
